# Grading

Students will be assessed on 9 assignments (60% of grade) and a final
exam (40% of grade).

Assignments may be submitted as a quarto
file (other formats by request). The instructor should be able to compile
an HTML or PDF output file from the submitted source file. **Assignments
submitted in word processor file formats, including Microsoft Word, will
not be accepted**. Hand-written assignments (including scanned documents)
are also not permitted. Students will be introduced to valid document
formats during the course.

All assignments will be submitted electronically, via students' private
GitHub repositories. Instructions on how to set up and use GitHub accounts
will be provided.

## Final exam

Information about the final exam will be released mid-November.

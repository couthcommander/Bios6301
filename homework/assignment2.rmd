Add your name as `author` to the file's metadata section.

Submit a single knitr file (named `homework2.rmd`) by email to sarah.c.lotspeich@vanderbilt.edu.
Place your R code in between the appropriate chunks for each question.
Check your output by using the `Knit HTML` button in RStudio.

1. **Working with data** In the `datasets` folder on the course GitHub repo, you will find a file called `cancer.csv`, which is a dataset in comma-separated values (csv) format. This is a large cancer incidence dataset that summarizes the incidence of different cancers for various subgroups. (18 points)

    1. Load the data set into R and make it a data frame called `cancer.df`. (2 points)

    2. Determine the number of rows and columns in the data frame. (2)

    3. Extract the names of the columns in `cancer.df`. (2)

    4. Report the value of the 3000th row in column 6. (2)

    5. Report the contents of the 172nd row. (2)

    6. Create a new column that is the incidence *rate* (per 100,000) for each row. The incidence rate is the `(number of cases)/(population at risk)`, which in this case means `(number of cases)/(population at risk) * 100,000`. (3)

    7. How many subgroups (rows) have a zero incidence rate? (2)

    8. Find the subgroup with the highest incidence rate.(3)

2. **Data types** (10 points)

    1. Create the following vector: `x <- c("5","12","7")`. Which of the following commands will produce an error message? For each command, Either explain why they should be errors, or explain the non-erroneous result. (4 points)

            max(x)
            sort(x)
            sum(x)

    2. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)

            y <- c("5",7,12)
            y[2] + y[3]

    3. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)

            z <- data.frame(z1="5",z2=7,z3=12)
            z[1,2] + z[1,3]

3. **Data structures** Give R expressions that return the following matrices and vectors (*i.e.* do not construct them manually). (3 points each, 12 total)

    1. $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)$
    
    2. $(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)$

    3. $\begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 1 & 1  \\
      1 & 0 & 1  \\
      1 & 1 & 0  \\
    \end{pmatrix}$

    4. $\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
      1 & 4 & 9 & 16 \\
      1 & 8 & 27 & 64  \\
      1 & 16 & 81 & 256 \\
      1 & 32 & 243 & 1024  \\
    \end{pmatrix}$

4. **Basic programming** (10 points)

    1. Let $h(x,n)=1+x+x^2+\ldots+x^n = \sum_{i=0}^n x^i$. Write an R program to calculate $h(x,n)$ using a `for` loop. As an example, use `x = 5` and `n = 2`. (5 points)

    1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write an R program to perform the following calculations. (5 points)

        1. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000. (3, [euler1])

        1. Find the sum of all the multiples of 4 or 7 below 1,000,000. (2)

    1. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be $(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89)$. Write an R program to calculate the sum of the first 15 even-valued terms. (5 bonus points, [euler2])

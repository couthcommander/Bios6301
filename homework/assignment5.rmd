$5^{n=day}$ points taken off for each day late.

40 points total.

Submit a single knitr file (named `homework5.rmd`), along with a valid PDF output file. Inside the file, clearly indicate which parts of your responses go with which problems (you may use the original homework document as a template). Add your name as `author` to the file's metadata section. Raw R code/output or word processor files are not acceptable.

Failure to name file `homework5.rmd` or include author name may result in 5 points taken off.

### Question 1 ###

**15 points**

A problem with the Newton-Raphson algorithm is that it needs the derivative $f'$. If the derivative is hard to compute or does not exist, then we can use the *secant method*, which only requires that the function $f$ is continuous.

Like the Newton-Raphson method, the **secant method** is based on a linear approximation to the function $f$. Suppose that $f$ has a root at $a$. For this method we assume that we have *two* current guesses, $x_0$ and $x_1$, for the value of $a$. We will think of $x_0$ as an older guess and we want to replace the pair $x_0$, $x_1$ by the pair $x_1$, $x_2$, where $x_2$ is a new guess.

To find a good new guess x2 we first draw the straight line from $(x_0,f(x_0))$ to $(x_1,f(x_1))$, which is called a secant of the curve $y = f(x)$. Like the tangent, the secant is a linear approximation of the behavior of $y = f(x)$, in the region of the points $x_0$ and $x_1$. As the new guess we will use the x-coordinate $x_2$ of the point at which the secant crosses the x-axis.

The general form of the recurrence equation for the secant method is:

$$x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i)\frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})}$$

Notice that we no longer need to know $f'$ but in return we have to provide *two* initial points, $x_0$ and $x_1$.

**Write a function that implements the secant algorithm.** Validate your program by finding the root of the function $f(x) = \cos(x) - x$. Compare its performance with the Newton-Raphson method -- which is faster, and by how much?  For this example $f'(x) = -\sin(x) - 1$.

### Question 2 ###

**20 points**

The game of craps is played as follows (this is simplified). First, you roll two six-sided dice; let x be the sum of the dice on the first roll. If x = 7 or 11 you win, otherwise you keep rolling until either you get x again, in which case you also win, or until you get a 7 or 11, in which case you lose.

Write a program to simulate a game of craps. You can use the following snippet of code to simulate the roll of two (fair) dice:

```{r}
    x <- sum(ceiling(6*runif(2)))
```

1. The instructor should be able to easily import and run your program (function), and obtain output that clearly shows how the game progressed.  Set the RNG seed with `set.seed(100)` and show the output of three games. (lucky 13 points)

1. Find a seed that will win ten straight games.  Consider adding an argument to your function that disables output. Show the output of the ten games. (7 points)

### Question 3 ###

**5 points**

This code makes a list of all functions in the base package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
objs <- mget(ls("package:base"), inherits = TRUE)
funs <- Filter(is.function, objs)
```

Using this list, write code to answer these questions.

1. Which function has the most arguments? (3 points)

1. How many functions have no arguments? (2 points)

Hint: find a function that returns the arguments for a given function.

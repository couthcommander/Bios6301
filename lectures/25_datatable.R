# 1. Convert date columns into a usable (for analysis) format.  Use the `table` command to display the counts of the year from `init.date`.
# 2. Create an indicator variable (one which takes the values 0 or 1 only) to represent death within 1 year of the initial visit.  How many observations died in year 1?
# 3. Use the `init.date`, `last.visit` and `death.date` columns to calculate a followup time (in days), which is the difference between the first and either the last visit or a death event (whichever comes first). If these times are longer than 1 year, censor them (this means if the value is above 365, set followup to 365).  Print the quantile for this new variable.
# 4. Create another indicator variable representing loss to followup; this means the observation is not known to be dead but does not have any followup visits after the first year.  How many records are lost-to-followup?
